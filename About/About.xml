--- Original Description ---
Allows you to change how pawns are generated.

Gender Frequency
Allows you to set which gender is the most frequent.
There's an option to ignore backstory forced gender.

Body Type
Set what body types are allowed for the pawns.
Change how backstories affect pawns from receiving an average body type of the opposite gender.

Forced/Blocked Traits
You can force traits to always be given to them or disallow them from receiving some traits.
Forcing/Blocking ALL of the traits will cause an infinite loop, making you unable to play.
You can force the same type of trait with different degrees.

Preserve Age Curve
This will attempt to mimic the vanilla age curve to the new age limit if you've enabled minimum age and/or maximum age.
Disabling this will only clamp their age to the new age limit.

Minimum Age
Set a minimum starting age for the pawns.
There's an option to ignore baby pawns.

Maximum Age
Pawns wont age past the designated value.
You can set if the excess age is added to their chronological age instead.

Aging Tick Speed
Set how fast the pawns age.
Setting to 0 will make them unable to age.
A value of 3 means they age 3 times faster.</description>
